# Images in the Project

This folder contains four key figures used in the report for STAT 5243, providing visual insights into the cell clustering and gene expression analysis of the frog tail regeneration project.

## 1. UMAP of Frog Tail Cells (PCA + Leiden Clusters)
![UMAP of Frog Tail Cells - PCA + Leiden Clusters](images/5243proj1_f1.png)
This figure shows the UMAP visualization of the frog tail cells after performing PCA and Leiden clustering. 28 distinct clusters are identified, representing the diversity of cell populations involved in regeneration.

## 2. UMAP of Frog Tail Cells (kNN Clusters)
![UMAP of Frog Tail Cells - kNN Clusters](images/5243proj1_f2.png)
This UMAP plot displays cell clusters generated using k-nearest neighbors (kNN) clustering. The results highlight 10 major cell groups, revealing structural differences compared to the PCA + Leiden approach.

## 3. Top Marker Genes for Each Cluster
![Top Marker Genes for Each Cluster](images/5243proj1_f3.png)
This figure lists the top marker genes for each cluster identified through Leiden clustering, showing gene expression variation and the unique gene profiles of the different cell groups.

## 4. Heatmap of ROC Marker Genes Across Clusters
![Heatmap of ROC Marker Genes](images/5243proj1_f4.png)
This heatmap visualizes the expression levels of Regeneration-Organizing Cell (ROC) marker genes across different clusters, providing insights into their role in coordinating the regenerative process.
